<p><strong>Thee Guide</strong>, also known as "Beremy's Fantastic Guide 2 Stamina Improvement", refers to a guide created by Beremy to help players quickly and effectively achieve higher <a href="https://itgwiki.dominick.cc/en/game-mechanics/difficulty">block level</a> passes in stamina. Thee Guide primarily recommends that players prioritize speed and streams around 32 measures in length over longer and longer songs of the same BPMs.</p>
<h3><strong>Steps to Thee Guide</strong></h3>
<p>The original steps to Thee Guide are as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Stop caring about block difficulty; Only care about (Bpm, max-passed-measures). Example Why Block Difficulty Is A Meme: 192m@180 and 140m@200 are both 17s</li>
  <li>Can you pass more than 64 measures of &lt;BPM&gt;? Nice! Stop playing that BPM outside of your warmups</li>
  <li>Can you pass a song with 400+m of &lt;BPM&gt;? Nice! Stop playing that BPM entirely. not even as your first song</li>
  <li>Play 3 times a week, give yourself a rest day between sets. v important that you consistently do this over many weeks</li>
  <li>Google “How much protein do I need to build muscle” and eat that much every day</li>
  <li>If you’re not improving over the course of a month you’re fucking up one of the above points -- fix it.</li>
</ol>
