<p>Technical / Fantastic Attack is a playstyle where players aim to score as high as possible. Technical charts feature tricky patterns or rhythms to challenge the player's accuracy and technical execution.</p>
<h1>Technical Notation</h1>
<p>Technical songs will often use the description field to give an overview of which techniques will be tested. Common tech. notation include XO (crossovers), FS (footswitch) and BR (brackets).</p>
<p>For an detailed explanation of execution and notation see <a href="https://itgwiki.dominick.cc/en/playstyles/tech/notation">Technical Notation</a>.</p>
<h1>Scoring Systems</h1>
<p>The ultimate goal of the technical / FA play style is to achieve the highest possible <a href="https://itg.wiki/wiki/Judgments">judgment</a> on each note. In ITG, this would involve getting a Fantastic on every note in the chart by hitting each within 23 milliseconds. Some <a href="https://itg.wiki/wiki/StepMania_Themes">Stepmania Themes</a> have a mode called FA+, which added a tighter timing window, Blue Fantastic, which is 15ms. Tournaments often feature this 15ms window. If players are playing on the FA+ setting, this is achieved by splitting the Fantastic window into two, with Fantastics that have an error of less than 15ms being a Blue Fantastic, and all others being a White Fantastic. For players using the Waterfall theme, the 15ms window is referred to as the Masterful window.</p>
<p>Themes and tournaments may modify the points assigned to each of the judgements. Modifications of this sort often address the overly harsh impact of a Miss in ITG's standard scoring system.</p>
