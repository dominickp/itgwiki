<p>Technical notation is a set of abbreviations that indicate what techniques are present in a chart. Most modern packs in <a href="https://itgwiki.dominick.cc/en/playstyles/technical-and-fantastic-attack">Tech and FA</a> feature tech notation. It is entered in the Simfile Author field in .sm files or Description field in .ssc files. To see tech notation, you need to use a theme which displays it, such as Simply Love.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/QtgBRtwx0Q4">This video</a> gives a good overview of technical notation.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p><strong>DS+ XO BR-</strong></p>
<p>This chart has a lot of double steps (DS), some crossovers (XO), and a few brackets (BR).</p>
<h2>Common Notations</h2>
<p><strong>+ and -</strong> Plus after an abbreviation means the chart has a lot of that tech. Minus means there isn't much.</p>
<p><strong>BR</strong> - <strong>Brackets</strong> - Jumps intended to be hit with one foot. The player puts their foot diagonally across two panels, such as left and up.</p>
<p><strong>BU - Bursts -</strong> Fast, short sequences of notes, usually 24ths, 32nds, or 16ths at high BPMs.</p>
<p><strong>DS - Double Steps -</strong> Steps where a player hits 2 consecutive notes, on different arrows, with the same foot. DS are often marked with a mine under the first step, or a hold during the steps.</p>
<p><strong>FS - Footswitches -</strong> Two or more steps on the same arrow (either up or down) where the player alternates feet. These are often marked with a mine.</p>
<p><strong>JA or JH - Jacks -</strong> Two or more steps on the same arrow that are hit with the same foot.</p>
<p><strong>MA - Mine Avoidance -&nbsp;</strong> Not to be confused with Marvelous Attack in DDR.</p>
<p><strong>RH or SK - Rhythms</strong> (sometimes called Skittles) - Unusual or difficult rhythms such as tuplets and odd time signatures.</p>
<p><strong>SS - Sideswitches -</strong> Two or more steps on one of the side panels (right or left) where the player alternates feet. A player usually has to crossover into or out of a sideswitch. These are often marked with a mine.</p>
<p><strong>STR - Stream -</strong> Continuous streams of arrows, usually 16ths. May be followed by Breakdown Notation which is used in <a href="https://itg.wiki/wiki/Stamina_/_Footspeed">Stamina_/_Footspeed</a> charts.</p>
<p><strong>XMOD - X Speed Mod -</strong> Song contains <a href="https://itg.wiki/wiki/Gimmicks">Gimmicks</a> such as speed changes and stops. In some tournaments, the player may not use C-Mod on these files.</p>
<p><strong>XO - Crossovers -</strong> Steps where a player "crosses over" and hits the left arrow with their right foot or vice versa.</p>
