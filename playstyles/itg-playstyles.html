<p>ITG has three general and non-exclusive playstyles: Stamina, Tech/FA, and Mods. There is an additional division with bar usage; generally people hold it on to it for balance in modern ITG, but no-bar is also common.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/FyBlbidSbEY">This video</a> gives a good high-level overview of the different playstyles.</p>
<h1>Casual</h1>
<h1>Stamina / Footspeed</h1>

<p>The songs in the <a href="https://itgwiki.dominick.cc/en/playstyles/stamina-and-footspeed">Stamina / Footspeed</a> category aim to challenge the physical capabilities of the players through the length and speed of the songs. Stamina charts predominantly feature continuous streams with minimal tech or mods.</p>
<h1>Technical / Fantastic Attack</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://itgwiki.dominick.cc/en/playstyles/technical-and-fantastic-attack">Technical / Fantastic Attack</a> playstyle challenges players to accurately play the chart while executing tricky patterns such as crossovers, footswitches and brackets.</p>
<h1>Mods</h1>
<p><a href="https://itgwiki.dominick.cc/en/playstyles/mods">Mod</a> charts challenge the player's reading abilities. Effects are applied to the arrows to make them more difficult to read.</p>
<h1>Doubles</h1>
<p>A game mode/play style that uses both sides of the dance pad (8 panels) designed to challenge players' ability to accurately play charts that force the player to move across both pads.</p>
<h1>Couples</h1>
<p>Couples charts are specially designed for 2 players. There is a <a href="https://itgwiki.dominick.cc/en/software/stepmania-noteskins">noteskin</a> that colors the arrows according to player. The players move across both pads.</p>
