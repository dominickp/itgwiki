<p><strong>Difficulty</strong> is a measure of how physically challenging a chart is to complete. All charts in ITG are assigned a numeric <strong>difficulty rating,</strong> sometimes called a <strong>block level,</strong> to give an estimate of how physically demanding it is to execute a chart well enough to avoid failing.</p>
<p>The original/"stock" ITG difficulty scale ranged from 1 (easiest) to 13 (hardest), with only three Singles charts (The Expert charts for <i>Pandemonium</i>, <i>Summer ~Speedy Mix~</i>, and <i>VerTex^2</i>) and three Doubles charts (The Expert charts for <i>!</i>, <i>Energizer,</i> and <i>VerTex^2</i>) being rated a 13. This scale was largely based on and extrapolated from the original difficulty scale from DanceDanceRevolution (prior to the scale rework that took place in DanceDanceRevolution X) which ranged from 1 to 10, with a "10" in ITG and a "10" in DDR being roughly the same level of challenge.</p>
<p>Simfile authors may assign difficulties for each chart in a file according to their best judgment, with other "established" custom charts or the original ITG officials serving as reference points. As a result, there is inherent subjectivity in the rating process, and most players acknowledge that defining exact thresholds for "borderline" charts can be difficult.</p>
<p>In the modern "post-ITG" era of pad customs, <strong>there is no defined "upper limit" for difficulty</strong> - At the time of writing, charts rated as high as 32 on Singles<a href="https://itg.wiki/wiki/Difficulty#cite_note-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and 20 on Doubles<a href="https://itg.wiki/wiki/Difficulty#cite_note-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> have been confirmed to be passed.</p>
<h1>Difficulty Slots</h1>
<p>There are five "standard" difficulty slots for a given simfile, commonly referred to as <strong>Novice, Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert.</strong> In addition to these five, simfiles may have additional charts placed in <strong>Edit</strong> slots, though this practice is very uncommon in most custom files today. These difficulty slot names, along with the numeric rating of the chart in a given slot are used as part of common shorthand used when discussing stepcharts to ensure clarity.</p>
<p><i>(Example: A Singles chart in the Expert difficulty slot with a difficulty rating of 11 can be referred to as "SX11." A Doubles chart in the Medium difficulty slot with a rating of 6 can be referred to as "DM6.")</i></p>
