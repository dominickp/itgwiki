<p>It is the sequel to <a href="https://itgwiki.dominick.cc/en/packs-and-simfiles/pack-details/Cirque-du-Zeppelin"><i>Cirque du Zeppelin</i></a> (2014). It is named after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimac_Nevera"><i>Rimac Nevera</i></a>, and themed after the Japanese manga/anime series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_the_Lustrous"><i>Houseki no Kuni</i></a> (Land of the Lustrous).</p>
<p>It is the first new addition to the <i>Cirque </i>series in the 2020s, and the first since <a href="https://itgwiki.dominick.cc/en/packs-and-simfiles/pack-details/Cirque-du-Miura">Cirque du Miura</a> (2019). It is the 10th in the Cirque series overall.</p>
<p>It is also the the first pack in the series to feature ITG doubles charts, as well as Pump It Up singles charts and Pump It Up doubles charts.</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Cirque Nevera is structured identically to existing Cirque series packs, including four ITG Singles charts (Easy → Challenge) for every individual song, and one ITG Singles chart for each mix and mix partition. In addition, this format is duplicated for all ITG Doubles, Pump It Up Singles and Pump It Up Doubles charts (with one simfile (Metaphor) exempt from this format). There are 308 ITG Singles charts, 306 ITG Doubles charts, 306 Pump It Up Singles charts and 306 Pump It Up Doubles charts.</p>
<p>ITG Doubles charts are autogenerated using <a href="https://github.com/0xB0C5/doublify">Doublify</a>.<br>Pump It Up Singles charts are generated using <a href="https://github.com/aeubanks/itggen">aeubanks/itggen</a>.<br>Pump It Up Doubles charts are generated using <a href="https://github.com/sbcat/pumpdoublify">PumpDoublify</a>.</p>
<p>One simfile contains charts with technical elements (Metaphor). The Medium and Expert charts for this simfile were omitted from the autogenerated versions. One simfile has visual effects (OIIA OIIA), and one has three different .ogg length cuts, along with a <code>FastEnd.lua</code> script to end the chart early (Sequential Dreambox).</p>
<p>There are five mixes in the pack, each one split into between 2 and 5 parts of roughly 10-15 minutes each. Mixes and mix parts have a prefix in the titled marked as <code>[Mix]</code> and are placed at the end of the songwheel</p>
<p>There are also five simfiles in the pack marked as New Number Pack. These simfiles contain charts with unbroken streams of either 32 or 64 measures, at 5bpm increments from 150 to 170. These special charts are prefixed with <code>[NNP]</code> and are also placed at the end of the songwheel, but before the mixes.</p>
<p>All simfiles are synced to NULL (0.000ms) offset and a pack.ini is included in the folder.</p>
<blockquote>

  <figcaption><i>The mythical Cirque du Agera strikes again</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Before 2023</strong></p>
<p>The origin of Cirque Nevera, like many of its forebears, can trace its lineage back to an infamous pack in my simfilography called <i>Cirque du Agera</i>. This pack name has historically been the first name for nearly every Cirque pack since Cirque du Lykan, at one point being the assigned name given to Cirque du Lykan, Cirque du Enzo, Cirque du Miura, and, most relevant to this story, a project known simply as the “Amazing Pack”. In late 2014, following the success of one particular simfile in Zeppelin: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZwrvUiEbcyY"><i>Amazing</i></a>, I thought it might be a nice idea to develop a pack comprised entirely of the same genre of music, at similar bpms and difficulty levels. This pack would serve as a spinoff sequel to Zeppelin.</p>
<p>The Amazing Pack (now known as Cirque du Agera), never progressed past the concept stage, but one chart was written and released in Cirque du Enzo (Cannonball), to test for such a project. Whilst Cannonball was a moderate success, seeing usage in ECFA2021, I was not motivated enough to commit to the work.</p>
<p>The concept of an official Cirque du Zeppelin sequel, irrespective of its name or specific theming, had always existed since Zeppelin first released. Since Zeppelin was a sidequest pack, and had not been “a part of the plan”, it never received a whole lot of attention, and even as its popularity grew, my interest in stream files was firmly in the 170+ bpms. In 2019, Cirque du Miura would act as a sort of halfway sequel, drawing structural elements from Zeppelin as well as Enzo, but the strict bpm range of that pack meant it was closer to Enzo than Zeppelin.</p>
<p>2020 marked the beginning of the tech saga of my career, so all stream packs slowed in development considerably.</p>

  <figcaption><i>Cirque du Zeppelin 2's initial songlist (2022)</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Cirque du Zeppelin 2 made its first stirring of life in December 2022, just like with every other one of my packs, as a text file in an otherwise empty folder, numbered 1 to 30. For one and a half years, this was to be its entire songlist, and nothing more would be made of it. When the spreadsheet tab in my internal sheet was made (April 12, 2024), all four of these songs were promptly rejected from the pack and the songlist was thus empty for some months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After <a href="https://itgwiki.dominick.cc/en/packs-and-simfiles/pack-details/Tachyon-Eta"><i>Tachyon Eta</i></a>'s release in November 2024 and its fast development and delivery time, I had the freedom to start exploring existing and ongoing projects. Whilst I had some ongoing active projects (<a href="https://itgwiki.dominick.cc/en/packs-and-simfiles/pack-details/Zaias-TechDX"><i>Zaia's TechDX</i></a>, <a href="https://itgwiki.dominick.cc/en/packs-and-simfiles/pack-details/Zaias-Dance-Dance-Rebuild"><i>Zaia's Dance Dance Rebuild</i></a>), I also had some more dormant ongoing projects that I was either unable to work on (<a href="https://itgwiki.dominick.cc/en/packs-and-simfiles/pack-details/New-Number-Pack"><i>New Number Pack</i></a>) or terrified of (<a href="https://itgwiki.dominick.cc/en/packs-and-simfiles/pack-details/City-Pop"><i>City Pop</i></a>), and started exploring something similar to Tachyon Eta that I felt I could also develop with a similar level of expedience. Returning to my roots with Cirque was something I was resolved to do in 2025, and I believed there was no better reintroduction to the series than with the one that I never felt like I gave any proper attention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cirque du Zeppelin 2 officially began work on <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/p4h3dq.png">December 10, 2024</a>, as was recorded by <a href="https://discord.com/channels/165133532199387136/591853601375125504/1315979528224510053">this post</a> in Stamina Nation. The first charts to be written were lowers to existing expert charts that were being homed in this pack. By <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/annx8u.png">December 31</a>, it was 40 completed simfiles in size.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Work progressed slowly after the new year, and entered a lull during the ITL/SRPG curation season. Development on Syncatto occupied July, and then in August and September I was devoted to a classified tech project, then in October I worked on the ECS upper marathon and then straight into finishing Nevera. Over a 30 day period in October, I stepped 1900 measures for the ECS marathon, 800 measures for i can still feel the afterglow, 2350 measures for Hypertranced and 2520 measures for Taishi God, for a total of 7500 measures of <i>just </i>mix work. There was an extra 1000 or so measures of singles on top of that.</p>
<p>The mixes began to be integrated into the pack from May 2025, starting with <i>Frederhythm</i>, then <i>Alaguan Bootlegs Mix</i> and then some weeks later with <i>i can still feel the afterglow</i>. For a number of months, these were to be the only planned mixes until<a href="https://files.catbox.moe/wvcb5x.png"> learning about the ECS14 upper marathon <i>TRANCEMANIAXXX ~Hypertranced~</i> in early September</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Taishi God</i> came into existence because of <a href="https://discord.com/channels/165133532199387136/591858300790767616/1425916559796207718">this specific message in Stamina Nation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the introduction of the mixes, the intended songlist count was going to be 50 songs, but then as each mix was added, and then as the idea to split them occured, the songlist grew to 60, then to 65, and then capping out at a round 70 by the end of June. One month later it grew to 75, and this was to be the intended final size until the introduction of Hypertranced, which grew it again to 85, and then once Taishi God was added, it reached 90. A few last minute additions saw the pack reach its final size of 95 in the last week of October. I briefly considered making it a flat 100 but this thought came too late in development.</p>
<p>One of the most popular simfiles in Cirque du Zeppelin was <a href="https://youtu.be/lhZ6FGN5ius"><i>Endless Flyer</i></a>, which was a single stream chart of 64 measures' length. This chart was popular as an entry level 14, as well as a “new number” chart. Equally popular were the “New Number Pack” questline charts in StaminaRPG6 (2022), which were a ladder of short 32-measure charts at 10bpm increments. Cirque Nevera contains five simfiles at 150, 155, 160, 165 and 170 bpm, each with 32 and 64 measure length streams. These organically evolved as development of the pack progressed and I was finding songs that I couldn't make great cuts out of, but were either short or had one section that was good. The first of these that was distinctly defined as an “NNP” chart was Dnr.</p>
<p>Muma was added to the pack after I learned about the ECS upper marathon, and this was an instant favorite song in the mix, so I produced a single out of it.</p>
<p>The ITG-Doubles, Pump-Singles and Pump-Doubles charts were added on November 04-05 using existing conversion models. I had access to a second, superior Pump-Singles converter called <i>4to5</i> by Mdigibou, which does a more faithful conversion of the source chart to Pump-Singles, but there were known concerns of doublesteps in the output charts, and the charts themselves needed manual integration with the original .ssc files, which, for 95 songs, was too much work.</p>
<p><strong>Name</strong></p>
<p>Cirque du Zeppelin 2 received its official name “Nevera” on October 30, 2024, after the Rimac Nevera, an electric sports car.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The decision to drop the “du” part of the name occurred about a week prior, when I was still writing the bulk of the ITGWiki articles for my other packs, as well as the Timeline and Gantt charts in my releases spreadsheet. I was reflecting on the Cirque brand and thinking of ways to optimize it in the 2020s - especially as I hadn't released one in half a decade at this point - a new Cirque for the modern era would require a fresh and invigorated look to set it apart from its ancestors. To put it bluntly - I no longer needed the “du”. The series was well-known enough by this point that just “Cirque” was sufficient to act as the series title, with the entry title to immediately follow. I tested this with existing packs as well as theoretical ones, and I was pleased with the results.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br>I liked the quickened syllable cadence between the series title and the entry title, and by employing a vocalized consonant (the -k sound) as opposed to a vocalized vowel (the -uu sound), this allows greater versatility with car names for future packs that were previously sub-optimal with the old name convention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Artistic Influences and Chart Design</h2>
<p>It had been a number of years since I'd produced charts in this bpm range in bulk, but everything I'd learned from stepping faster charts was able to be employed here. What was of notable utility were all the things I'd been able to learn and practice whilst writing tech, and the different perspectives I'd allowed myself to analyze songs from had improved the breadth of my range. I was able to approach these songs with a high level of confidence and be certain I would be able to write the charts I was seeing in my head to them.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous Cirque pack, Miura, this pack does not have any specific pattern theming. It is written “organically” with whatever skills and metagame ideas I had at the time it was made. Everything is stepped “normally”. I made a point of avoiding including any more than a couple of resteps in the pack, like Zeppelin had before it, and especially avoiding <i>older </i>music (anything more than a decade old). I wanted plenty of fresh, modern sounds for this new Cirque.</p>
<p>The past few years spent honing my skills had not really resulted in many hard breakthroughs in ability - I still maintain that I am at my current limit for “hard” skills, but this pack displays improvements in “soft" skills that I learned from writing technical charts and footspeed charts. Things such as smoother difficulty transition curves and better internal consistency and pattern motifs, and better-defined pattern scaling and richer pattern networks, whilst not necessarily quantifiable improvements in craft, represent qualitative “lateral” improvements that have to led to overall improved work. Being able to practice these at lower bpms will give me the skill platform to adapt them into higher bpms in the future. On the mechnical side of things, I didn't filter any patterning, but I operated within a general range with lower and upper limits of pattern difficulty. There are no extended trill sections, nearly no footspeed bursts and deliberate uses of monodirectional patterning.</p>
<p>I had already had gained some experience with mixes, so the mixes featured in this pack were more of the same quality I was comfortable with. When I produce all of my mixes, I don't pitch-shift when altering the tempos, but I tried something different with Taishi God and pitch-shifted everything, with the sole exception of The Angels. That was the only song I couldn't get used to in a different pitch.</p>
<p>The inclusion of alternate charts came as a response to a growing interest in doubles and Pump It Up custom content. I intend for there to be charts for all four game modes in the future in all of my future stream packs. All ITG-Doubles charts were checked for bleeding notes after rolls and were shortened where required. No alterations were made to any of the Pump It Up charts.</p>
<p><strong>Ratings</strong></p>
<p>Ratings for all ITG Singles charts were determined by using a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C5e5I-jdrJDuvNh037FKZsdE1JZODr9XaDVpBgL8cmY/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet with all ECS and SRPG chart data up to SRPG8</a>. Ratings were cross-referenced with volume and density data in the sheet, and where needed, I looked up individual charts in Stamina Nation to read discourse surrounding them. All ratings for Doubles and Pump charts remain unaltered.</p>
<h2>Graphics</h2>
<p>All Houseki no Kuni artworks used in this pack are by artist 古陵. <a href="https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/15251377">Pixiv link</a>. Aside from the pack's primary graphic, artworks from this artist were also used in i can still feel the afterglow and Taishi God.</p>
<p>The font used in the primary graphic is <a href="https://www.1001fonts.com/centers-george-font.html">Centers George</a>. It required no editing to achieve the vertical offset effect, and it came with built-in ligatures (check the ER in Nevera).</p>
<p>I had wanted to theme a Cirque pack after Houseki no Kuni <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e1BHW3nv6k">ever since I first watched it in 2017</a>. There had been attempts made with Cirque du Miura and Cirque du Huayra in the past but finding something practical had always proven itself to be difficult. Despite having some of the most beautiful fanart I've ever seen, these arts are often far too complicated to work well with text over them. I was able to get around this by positioning the text around the graphic.</p>
<p>The marathons all received their own graphics.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Alaguan Bootlegs Mix: I used a Windows XP Virtual Machine and set up Windows Media Player to display the song titles and lengths</li>
  <li>Frederhythm: uses titles and graphics from official band assets</li>
  <li>i can still feel the afterglow: inspired by <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Glitchbreak">Glitchbreak</a></li>
  <li>TRANCEMANIAXXX ~Hypertranced~: inspired by general y2k digital art and <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Metalheart">Metalheart</a></li>
  <li>Taishi God: inspired by Neoclassical graphic design</li>
</ul>
<p>The lotus flower has many symbolic meanings depending on which culture it is being attributed, but I adopted it here to mean <i>rebirth</i>, <i>purity </i>and <i>enlightenment</i>. With the newfound knowledge I have gained throughout my explorations over the past several years, I have returned back home to my roots and Cirque has been born again into a new form.</p>
<p>As has been the standard with my packs since Tachyon Eta, Cirque Nevera contains unique animated cdtitles. The distribution follows the scheme developed for <a href="https://itgwiki.dominick.cc/en/packs-and-simfiles/pack-details/Syncatto"><i>Syncatto</i></a>. This pack contains:</p>
<ul>
  <li>43 common cdtitles</li>
  <li>36 uncommon cdtitles</li>
  <li>10 rare cdtitles</li>
  <li>1 super rare cdtitle</li>
  <li>1 profile picture cdtitle</li>
  <li>3 special collaboration cdtitles (with StoryTime)</li>
  <li>1 special unique cdtitle (OIIA OIIA)</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately there are no prototype or draft graphics that I can share here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Songlist</h2>
<p><i>Cirque Nevera </i>contains 71 individual songs, 5 mixes and 19 mix parts.</p>

<h2>Reception and Retrospect</h2>
<p>Cirque Nevera was released on November 07, 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having reviewed Pump-Singles charts from both the aeubanks/itggen and the Mdigibou 4to5 tool, the 4to5 tool is <i>significantly </i>better at adapting the ITG Singles chart to Pump. It repeats motifs and doesn't feel as autogenerated as the itggen one. I wish it didn't have the doublestep risk, but even if it didn't, it also does not convert rolls and holds properly, and also requires manual integration with the source file if you want to have the output chart in the same .ssc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/trivia_1.png">
  <figcaption>Ayumi Hamaski eurobeat mix</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
  <li>Despite the Rimac Nevera being one of the fastest production cars at the time of writing, Cirque Nevera is <i>not</i> one of the fastest production packs.</li>
  <li>CADENZA intentionally omits the <i>BEMANI Sound Team</i> part of "lapix ∞ BEMANI Sound Team "L.E.D."".<ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.namu.wiki/w/BEMANI%20%EC%8B%9C%EB%A6%AC%EC%A6%88%20%EC%95%84%ED%8B%B0%EC%8A%A4%ED%8A%B8%20%EB%AA%85%EC%9D%98%20%EC%82%AD%EC%A0%9C%20%EB%85%BC%EB%9E%80">mostly disrespect</a></li>
      <li>The IIDX cut was stepped before being dropped from the pack in favor of other things, but when the full version came out in lapix's <i>Genexx Aura</i> album, it was resurrected. Everything in the short version chart was used in the long version</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>An Ayumi Hamasaki eurobeat mix was drafted but never made it to the mixing stage</li>
  <li>A <a href="https://youtu.be/aC_hXlog7nw">Kpop dnb mix</a> was also planned but this was cut when the bpm normalization process became too complicated</li>
  <li>Taishi God gave me an excuse to step my favorite Taishi song, The Angels, as well as a chance to step The Blue Sanctuary<ul>
      <li>Winteright has new steps (previously stepped in Cirque du Miura)</li>
      <li><a href="https://vgmdb.net/artist/32911">TRäkker</a>&nbsp;is a duo unit that features Taishi</li>
      <li>The .ssc file is 1.2mb</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/trivia_2.png">
  <figcaption>Rejected songs. Not all have steps</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
  <li>9 songs were stepped and rejected from the pack. Many more had skeletons made and around 25 were drafted and later removed</li>
  <li>A number of cut single songs were used in the Alaguan Bootlegs Mix and were able to make space for new singles<ul>
      <li>This mix is essentially the spiritual successor to the Amazing Pack</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <i>Cirque du Agera</i> name has moved on to be the assigned name to a different pack, but that is a story for another ITGWiki entry.</li>
