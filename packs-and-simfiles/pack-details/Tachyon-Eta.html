<p><i><strong>Tachyon Eta </strong></i>is a stream pack by Zaia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a revival of the popular <i>Tachyon </i>footspeed pack series by Mad Matt (2009-2018). This pack focuses on entry/intermediate level footspeed as well as short footspeed bursts alongside technical elements and serves to act as a bridge between bpm tiers.</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Simfiles are generally structured using the standard stream pack model: Experts are the top difficulty and lowers are stripped down versions of them, but the structure of the music facilitated more diversity with rhythms and many charts stripped down into sections of bursts rather than the generic 16th-to-8th conversions.</p>
<p>With the simfiles that feature charts with techs, there are two types: one is a type that retains techs through all difficulties; these are generally targeted towards the tech/FA type player and are designed like a chart you might find in ITL or another H2H event. Lowers for these focus difficulty around the burst usage. The other is a simfile that can target both stream-type players as well as tech-type players - these are more similar to what might be found in the StaminaRPG DPRT faction. Typically, these simfiles will have charts in the Edit slot, which are identical to another chart in the simfile just with any technical elements stripped out. Lowers for these focus around the tech usage.</p>
<p>In terms of patterning types, I have taken a fairly intermediate approach. There is nothing in this pack that is truly slide-heavy, and likewise, there is nothing that is overtly steppy or designed in the retro style. For players that are breaking into a new speed tier, I have opted to provide this middle approach to allow players to feel out what they like for themselves, so that they can specialize in their pattern skillsets using existing content (or create their own). For slide-exclusive players, given the smaller volumes and lower densities of streams, this pack could serve as an opportunity to practice patterning harder than they are used to and transitions that are no longer seen in the meta.</p>
<h2>Development</h2>
<p>There has existed a growing content gap in the 13-18 block spread for charts in the 230-280bpm range. Historically, this gap was serviced by the <i>Tachyon</i> series, which enabled players to access higher bpms with gradual difficulty progressions. However, the generation of players that grew up with these packs either never progressed beyond it or progressed so far beyond it that content in the series' scope was no longer relevant for them. New players, particularly those with slide-based forms, grow into new speeds through stream-heavy stamina content, adopting a volume-based approach, and these players bypass the types of charts that Tachyon traditionally provided. Players who are best-situated to produce lower volume, lower density but high speed content and be able to immediately consume it, are generally lacking in the requisite experience (and perhaps even interest) in writing this type of content, and their results may be suboptimal. The net result is a growing void of content being produced - in short, the people who are able to write this content well are writing content far above the difficulty level, and the people who are most suited to play this content are writing tech. This gap has been steadily growing for some years now, and it has become very noticeable by 2024.</p>
<p>Mad Matt's <i>Tachyon</i> series existed to facilitate speed growth. The series is named after the hypothetical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyon">Tachyon</a> subatomic particle, and individual packs are named after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet">Greek alphabet</a>. Starting with <i>Tachyon Alpha</i> in 2009, then <i>Tachyon Beta </i>(2010), <i>Tachyon Gamma </i>(2011), <i>Tachyon Delta </i>(2012), <i>Tachyon Epsilon </i>(2014) and concluding with <i>Tachyon Zeta</i> (2018), each pack was progressively more difficult than the last, allowing players to grow with them. In the contemporary era, these packs are still being recommended to novice footspeed players who are seeking growth in this area, and spinoffs of the main series that used the same songs extended the longevity of the series via packs such as <i>Tachyon Spectrum</i> (2013), <i>Tachyon Rebirth </i>(2019) and <i>Content Cop - Tachyon Epsilon</i> (2019).</p>
<p>Tachyon Eta, the seventh letter of the Greek alphabet, is a revival of the Tachyon series and a return to form through means of a “soft reset”, by refocusing on the core values for a new generation. Introducing new songs and a modernized design rhetoric, the project's ambition is to reinvigorate a chart type that has fallen out of the metagame for a number of years and to build new bridges between the speeds.</p>
<h2>Artistic Influences</h2>
<p>Tachyon Eta is directly influenced by the original series of packs - specifically Tachyons Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta, and some aspects of Epsilon. These packs featured a mix of charts that featured short bursts, long bursts and unbroken streams, though they trended towards unbroken blocks of streams as Matt improved as a player, which heavily influenced the structure of the chart types being written and included in the packs. Two pack series' with softer but nonetheless non-negligible influence were the SPEEEDCOOOORE and Sexuality Violation series, which featured a lot of bursty charts in the 240-260bpm range, which is a core range for footspeed training. All three were prominent community staple packs during the early 2010s.</p>
<p>Two relatively important artistic aspects that factored into my curation of the songlist was that new music was featured. Since the last Tachyon pack, the same songs would often be recycled with new charts - I myself did this extensively with unreleased packs like<i> Tachyon All-Stars</i> and <i>Tachyon Multiverse</i>, and indirectly by featuring songs associated with the Tachyon series in other packs, such as <i>fof </i>(unreleased), <i>Saitama's Ultimate Weapon </i>(2021) and <i>Tachyon Conent - The Next Quantization</i> (unreleased). Eta features songs that have been featured in prior events (Booyah, Hyperdance Rising, My Humps, Starflight, and to a lesser extent, Leave Me Alone), and this pack serves as their official home. The other aspect is that many different varieties of music are used - the Tachyon packs didn't focus on one type of music and offered a broad range; from chiptunes to speedcore to video game metal and beyond, and I believe that this helped contribute to the series' timelessness. I wanted to homage to the musical diversity by including those same genres, whilst adding some fresh modern ones. This pack is a little bit Tachyon, a little bit SPEEEDCOOOORE, a little bit Sexuality Violation and a little bit ITL and ECS and with charts that were quintessentially of their genres. For players who remember those old packs, it is by design that some of the charts in Tachyon Eta may evoke memories of specific charts from its lineage.</p>
<h2>Graphics</h2>

</figure>
<p>The artistic theming of this pack is drawn from the same sources of the original series. Graphics are generally science-inspired, alluding to themes of outer space and astrophysics. Tachyon Beta, as an example, uses the Hubble Deep Field image from 1995. Text uses typefaces that have futuristic or science fiction qualities, and some had been edited to give the text some horizontal blur to make them look like they're in motion. Tachyon Alpha's mathematical formulas in the background were a highlight of that pack's art, and is my favorite of the six mainline packs. Tachyon Rebirth must have felt similarly.</p>
<p>Originally, I experimented with some artistic depictions of tachyons, and for a long time I was working with one, but I found it difficult to compose text that was easy to read without significant blend layers doing the heavy lifting. As much as I liked this image artistically, I felt it wasn't as theme-appropriate as it could have been.</p>
<p>The image I ultimately went with was a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/nasas-webb-reveals-cosmic-cliffs-glittering-landscape-of-star-birth/">James Webb photograph of the Carina Nebula</a>, an absolutely breathtaking image of gases against a backdrop of bright, glittering stars. These gases form part of the star-forming region from which stars are born, which I felt was an appropriate to signal the “birth” of a new Tachyon.</p>
<p>I experimented fairly extensively with some graphical flairs to make the image more interesting. One such idea was to include the Greek letter Eta itself: η, but I couldn't get it to fit into the background smoothly. I made the text appear to shine like the stars in the background, or give the appearance that it was holographic. Pokémon and Yu-Gi-Oh! holo rares helped inform the look.</p>

<p>This pack features animated cdtitles- a first for me. In Tachyon Eta, every cdtitle is unique and also animated. I learned this was possible after reviewing a simfile in Stamina Nation, and realized during the review process that the stepartist's cdtitle happened to animate. After some investigation, I quickly learned how this was possible and capitalized on its potential. Each cdtitle was curated to match the song in some vague way.</p>

<h2>Reception</h2>
<p>Tachyon Eta released on October 10, 2024 to reviews</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<ul>
  <li>This pack went by the working title “Cirque du Jesko” in my internal spreadsheet. It was likely never destined to be a Cirque pack.</li>
  <li>Eta Carinae is a very bright star that resides within the Carina Nebula<ul>
      <li>There is a song in the pack titled “Nebula”, but this is purely coincidental</li>
