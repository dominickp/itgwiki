<p>Songs are added to StepMania in the form of "simfiles" which contain one or more "charts" and an actual audio file. These files are usually grouped in "packs" (which some <a href="https://itgwiki.dominick.cc/en/software/stepmania-themes">themes</a> refer to as "groups"). You can make your own charts or download ones created by others in the community. This page outlines some resources to find packs and simfiles.</p>
<p>Generally, simfiles come in a few different file formats:</p>
<ul>
  <li>.sm, used by Stepmania 4 and older versions and it's supported by most games.</li>
  <li>.dwi, legacy format originally used by Dance With Intensity.</li>
  <li>.ssc, used by Stepmania 5 and newer games.</li>
</ul>
<p>The scope of this category is to include any resources or informative pages regarding the creation, design, structure, etc. of simfiles. Pages for individual packs and simfiles should not be placed in this category.</p>
