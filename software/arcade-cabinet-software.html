<p>Din/TJ maintains an image designed to work on arcade cabinets (DDR or ITG) which support various lighting, monitor, and input setups. It comes pre-installed with StepMania 5.1b2 and Simply Love and includes a bunch of niceties an arcade machine owner might want. You can <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_lO2ddaYogve08u7CsjC6OojXy36ZfGgo7VCRVkLJhU/edit?usp=sharing">view the manual (which also has a link to download the image)</a>.</p>
