<p>Panels are the buttons that the user presses with their feet on an arcade-style dance pad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The material, cut, thickness of the center and arrow panels have a large impact on playability.</p>
<h1>Panel Materials</h1>
<h2><strong>Metal</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Stainless steel is the classic material of choice. in an arcade panel, it is 3mm thick. It absorbs and releases heat quickly, making it ideal for stamina when a fan is pointed at it.</li>
  <li>Aluminum is a cheaper alternative when making home pads</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Plastic</strong></h2>
<p>Plastic panels are generally used for arrow panels and lighting effects. They are slightly grippier than metal</p>
<ul>
  <li>Polycarbonate (aka Makrolon, Lexan) is the same plastic used in Bullet proof glass. Typical thicknesses include 6, 8 and 10mm. Compared to Acrylic, they tend to scuff and scratch more easily but are less likely to snap.</li>
  <li>Acrylic (aka Perspex) is a cheaper and clearer alternative to Polycarbonate. Typical thicknesses are the same as Polycarbonate. Note that anything less than 6mm has a tendency to snap. Acrylic panels are usually easier than Polycarbonate ones to machine (like when drilling holes and beveling edges with a router).</li>
  <li>PTFE (aka Teflon) is a material used for centre panels for low maintenance (no Pledge or baby powder), low grip sliding. Typical thickness is 2-3mm. Note if you attach it with tape, thicknesses below 2mm will sag and bow. Teflon heats up slower than Metal, but also releases heat more slowly. Teflon is still a relatively new technology for centre panels</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Wood</strong></h2>
<p>Timber is generally used in home pads as it is easy to machine with hand tools and cheap. Typical thickness is 6mm to 12mm.</p>
<p>Even when treated with polyurethane and Pledge, wood centre panels have heat buildup issues.</p>
<h1>Panel Treatment</h1>
<h2><strong>Baby Powder</strong></h2>
<p>Baby powder is often used to reduce friction. It is mostly applied to the centre panel</p>
<h2><strong>Pledge</strong></h2>
<p>Used by Stamina players to reduce friction, it works well on Metal and Wood, however is almost impossible to get off of Plastic panels. Use with extreme caution, as a tiny amount creates an extremely slippery surface</p>
<h2><strong>Windex</strong></h2>
<p>Windex is typically used to clean and increase grip on plastic panels. It can also be used to clean metal panels</p>
<h1>Panel Shape</h1>
<p>The two competing standards are “square” and “octagonal”. All original arcade panels are octagonal since they normally have a metal bracket that holds down the panel. Newer pads sometimes have square panels and a “bracketless” design with a countersunk bolt that holds down the panel.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Square panels enable less foot movement and simpler construction.</li>
  <li>Octagonal panels reduce accidental key presses as you can rest your feet on the arrow brackets</li>
</ul>
