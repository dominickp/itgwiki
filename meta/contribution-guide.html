<h2>Ideas for new pages</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GE1t0_Vk6g7IU-QMCyDpudwDVJ7wO3mqbAd8xsaPt0Q/edit?usp=sharing">Here's an outline</a> of what we brainstormed for this wiki.</p>
<p><strong>Tournament &amp; Event Pages</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>East Coast Stamina</li>
  <li>Stamina Con</li>
  <li>International Timing League (fka ECFA Online)</li>
  <li>Girls Coast Stamina</li>
  <li>French Coast Stamina</li>
  <li>French Toast FA</li>
  <li>Cupcake Timing Festival</li>
  <li>Rocky Mount</li>
  <li>Rumble In The Prairie</li>
  <li>UKSRT</li>
  <li>Mods Boot Camp</li>
  <li>List others as needed</li>
</ul>
<p>Preferably, these would ideally be written by someone involved with or intimately aware of the given event(s) who may be able to comment on things like event focus, venue, date held, pack design, and so on. These should most likely be kept <i>clean and professional</i> for the sake of documentation and "lore" preservation.</p>
<p><strong>Video Guides, Discussions, Podcasts, etc</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Rems' <a href="https://itg.wiki/w/index.php?title=Stamina_Radio&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Stamina Radio</a></li>
  <li>Beremy's Interviews and Lore Videos</li>
  <li>VincentITG's Interviews</li>
  <li>VincentITG's ECFA/<a href="https://itg.wiki/w/index.php?title=Dance_Game_Daily&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Dance Game Daily</a></li>
  <li>Etienne's Music/Rhythm Game Videos</li>
</ul>
<p>Not sure what these pages should contain beyond cataloging various dance game-related videos and series and listing a brief synopsis of them, but it would be interesting to at least centralize links to these content creators' videos.</p>
<h2>Article Types and Categorization</h2>
<p>Should we set up some basic categories and ideas for articles and pages that can be more easily grouped together? Right now there isn't a ton of organization (which is to be expected and understood, given things are just getting started) but it might be beneficial to proactively set up "buckets" for various articles to fall into, that way related resources can be more easily found. I'm thinking stuff like the way Remywiki groups event songs into a collapsable menu at the bottom of song pages, or the way Wikipedia itself has "Portals" for specific categories of article.</p>
<p>As some initial ideas, we might consider these categories, in addition to the ones already listed on the main page.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pad Maintenance and Improvements<ul>
      <li>Modding</li>
      <li>Friction Management</li>
      <li>Cleaning</li>
      <li>Troubleshooting</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Common Charting Styles<ul>
      <li>Technical</li>
      <li>Stream/Stamina</li>
      <li>Mods</li>
      <li>Simple/"All-Around"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pattern Terminology Dictionary</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to this, it might also be <i>extremely</i> prudent to determine if we want to/how we want to designate "joke" articles. Please refer to the Discussion page for this article for further commentary on that! It would probably be beneficial to be proactive in that regard - that way folks can still have fun with this wiki without running the risk of any newbies or beginners confusing community humor with legitimate resources and advice.</p>
<h2>Writing style</h2>
<p>Most articles should be written in a serious and correct style, especially ones that are useful resources for beginners or people external to ITG. But articles under the play styles (e.g. <a href="https://itg.wiki/wiki/Stamina_Challenges">Stamina Challenges</a>) can have a sarcastic, glib, tounge-in-cheek tone, inside jokes, or memes if the contributor wants it. If someone wants to start a semi-sarcastic page about stamina footwear choices or an overview of different types of pad lubrication, I think that's fine. Let's not take ourselves too seriously.</p>
<h2>Player profiles</h2>
<p>For now, don't create any player pages. To make sure anyone written about has control over what is said on their page, let's limit "player profiles" to an ITG Wiki's user page. That is to say, you can only write about a player if they have created an account on this ITG Wiki. For instance, this can be the player profile for Dom_ITG: <a href="https://itg.wiki/wiki/User:Domitg">User:Domitg</a>. This way, if Dom doesn't like something on his profile, he has the ability to change it.</p>
<h2>Editing and Formatting</h2>
<p>For descriptions and explanations on the various "wikitext" formatting tools available when writing or editing and article, refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext">this article</a>.</p>
<h2>Simfile links</h2>
<p>Because of the grey area around distributing simfiles, please do not link directly to simfiles or packs from this wiki. However, linking to other resources where users can find packs/simfiles themselves is okay.</p>
