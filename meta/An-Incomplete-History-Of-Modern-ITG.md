# An Incomplete History of Modern ITG
> This is going to start off as a total mess, but I need a place to thoughtdump everything I've learned in my research about this topic into one place, so I can get it all lined up into a cohesive timeline, explore the causes and effects of each "chapter" of the game's history, and better trace how everything trickled down into the future to shape the game as we know it today.
Buckle up, nerds. This is going to get messy.

## Origin and Purpose
In recent years, ITG/Pad Stepmania has experienced a sort of renaissance in popularity and outreach. With ever more global connectivity and ways to play at home, a new generation of players has been born and is growing more and more in the grassroots game we know and love. However, one thing that has always bothered me is how much information and history that I (or others) consider "common knowledge" about the game is simply unknown to new players and content creators. Given how much Modern ITG's foundation was innovated by, based on, and extrapolated from community decision-making and historic events (including everything from tournament format standards, chart design conventions, and playstyle differences), it is unfortunate that there exists no manner of documenting and communicating all of the knowledge and background information in the game and community beyond word of mouth. Perhaps this is why we call it "lore."

What I (Chief Skittles) have wanted to do for some time is to create some sort of documentary video, or podcast, or listenable media that would elucidate the origins behind a lot of the game and design conventions that have become such an intrinsic part of the meta today that new players or community members are likely to take them as "common knowledge" without understanding *why* they are as they are. However, what I've inadvertantly backed myself into is the scope creep of nightmares - there's simply so *so much* information that I find important, interesting, fascinating, or somehow connected to other facets of the game that I don't even know where to begin with what I want to say, much less form a cohesive thread of thought to base a single piece of media on, video or otherwise.

This document is intended to serve as a single place where I can, in great detail, develop a timeline of Modern ITG as a whole, tracing the path of history from the time of the earliest data I can find, (pre-r21 patch) to the current era, exploring as much of the game as I possibly can to explain how we ended up as we are now. I fully anticipate this to take an exceptional amount of time, despite having all of the information floating haphazardly in my brain, so I beg your patience as I develop this page.
